# Sqlite

* how to compile clsql-sqlite3 on ecl ? seems the only roadblock for reasonable compilation ...
* make a version of clsql-query for sqlite3 that eats as much rows as we want

# Pfff/ocaml

* create issue on github/facebook/pfff, asking for documentation?

# Features

* debugging using xdebug (breakpoints, var inspection, expression evaluation, the all shebang)
* make charts more interactive. select x subranges.
* go to definition of functions. is pfff-stags enough?

# Static analysis

* find tools. integrate.
* Build own tools???
